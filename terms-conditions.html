        <p>Buyer shall not be responsible for any order unless it is issued on a Purchase Order and no variation will be effective unless approved in writing by Buyer. Each shipment of Goods received by Buyer shall only be upon the terms of the Purchase Order and these Conditions of Purchase. Buyer objects to and rejects any additional or different terms proposed by Seller on an acceptance, invoice or other Seller document.</p>
        <p>Any reference to Seller’s quotation, bid or proposal does not imply acceptance by Buyer of any term, condition or instruction contained therein. In addition to other modes of acceptance, Seller’s acceptance of the Purchase Order or commencement of performance pursuant to the Purchase Order constitutes acceptance by Seller of, and binds Seller to, these Conditions of Purchase.</p>
        <p>The Purchase Order together with these Conditions of Purchase (collectively, the “Purchase Contract”) represents the entire agreement between Buyer and Seller, unless otherwise expressly agreed to in a writing signed by Buyer. Except as otherwise permitted by these Conditions of Purchase, no amendment, addition or modification of any provision of the Purchase Contract is binding unless it is in writing, signed by the party to be bound and is specifically described as an amendment or modification of the Purchase Contract. The number appearing on the Purchase Order must be quoted on all invoices, delivery dockets and parcels.</p>
